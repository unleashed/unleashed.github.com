    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>Everything that has a beginning has an end</p><footer><strong>The Oracle</strong><cite>The Matrix Revolutions</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Once again I'm starting a new blog. This is the beginning. Last one lasted for about eight months with about five of inactivity. I probably have started <em>more</em> blogs than posts in those blogs, so it's not that I care that much about my old rants. This time a number of things are different, and I hope those differences will... well, make a difference in my blogging and push forward in time that unavoidable end.</p>

<p>I hereby want to note that I very much do not care about visits or comments, what I <em>do</em> care about is having some sort of place where I can go to and write as much as I want on any topic. Yeah, I sometimes happen to want to write things down and make them available to others. No, it's not really all that often, but <em>having</em> a place does matter, so here it is...</p>

<p>Welcome to my home!</p>
